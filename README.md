# galaxy_spin_classifier

Morphology classifiers for galaxy spin research.


## Installation

Just install it like usual python packages. If you use pip, you can do

```
pip install -e .
```


## Usage

Please check the example notebooks for the usage of the CE-ResNet classifier.
Basically, it expects a 3x160x160 image and returns the emperical probability scores for the galaxy
to be a Z-Spiral, S-Spiral and Non-Spiral, respectively.
